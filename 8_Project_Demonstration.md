## 🎯 Final Project Summary

This project successfully implemented automated client-side logic on the ServiceNow Incident (`[incident]`) table to streamline user experience and enforce data governance.

### Core Achievements
- **Dynamic Field Manipulation:** Configured a UI Policy and `onChange` script to automatically adjust the `Urgency` field and lock critical parameters when an incident's `Impact` is set to `1 - High`.
- **Form Submission Governance:** Built an `onSubmit` validation script to prevent high-impact incidents from saving without an assigned technician, improving response workflow accuracy.
- **List-Level Protection:** Implemented an `onCellEdit` script to block direct state changes from the incident list view, ensuring lifecycle updates occur within the full record form.

## 🏆 Conclusion

By combining declarative ServiceNow tools (UI Policies) with programmatic scripts (Client Scripts), the solution creates a resilient data-validation framework. This minimizes user input errors, ensures compliance with high-priority incident protocols, and enhances overall operational efficiency within the platform.
